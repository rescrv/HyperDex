        (type THAT 10 times fast) to provide a lightweight
        (but highly effective) type check when extracting
        natives from v8 (as void pointers). The default
        implementation is fine for all cases i can think of, but i can
        concieve of one or two uses for specializations (e.g. storing the
        JS-side name of the class as the type ID).
        
        The type id must be unique per type except that subtypes may
        (depending on various other binding options) may need use the same
        value as the parent type. If multiple types share the same type ID,
        the type-safety check can be bypassed, _potentially_ leading to an
        illegal static_cast() and subsequent mis-use of the pointer. i
        stress the word "potentially" because to get that condition one
        would have to (A) abuse the object via the C++ API (which doesn't
        happen via the binding process, and you're probably also not going
        to do it) or (B) write some script code to confuse two bound native
        types about who is really who when a particular member is called.

        In the case of subclassed bound types, the
        ClassCreator_TypeID<SubClass> impl should subclass
        ClassCreator_TypeID<ParentClass>. Whether or not this is _required_
        for proper functionality depends at least in part on whether
        (ClassCreator_InternalFields<ParentType>::TypeIDIndex>=0). If it is
        negative, subclasses do not need to explicitly define this policy
        because the type ID won't be used for purposes of validating a JS-held
        pointer's native type.

        TODO: see if we can consolidate this type with TypeName<>. The problem
        at the moment is that JSToNative_ObjectWithInternalFieldsTypeSafe
        takes a (void const * &) and TypeName::Value is a (char const *), which
        won't convert to (void const *) in the context of template parameters.

       member. Failing to meet these prerequisites will cause a

       ACHTUNG SUBCLASSERS:

       When using a heirarchy of native types, more than one of which
       is compatible with CastFromJS(), conversions from subtype to 
       base type will fail unless all subtypes use the same internal 
       field placement as the parent type. If this code can detect a 
       mismatch then it will fail gracefully (e.g. a JS-side 
       exception), and if not then it might mis-cast an object and 
       cause Undefined Behaviour.

       If a given parent type uses a custom ClassCreator_InternalFields
       specialization then to ensure that subclasses always have the
       same placement, they "should" define their own policy like
       this:

       @code
       template <>
       struct ClassCreator_InternalFields< SubType >
           : ClassCreator_InternalFields< ParentType >
          {};
       @endcode

       That prohibits special internal field handling in the subtypes,
       but experience hasn't shown that subclasses need their own
       internal fields. Normaly a single internal field is all we need
       when binding native data. And when i say "normally", i mean
       "almost always."

       This must-match requirement is partially a side-effect of the library
       internally using the field count as a santiy check before trying to
       extract data from internal fields. It also exists so that the
       optional (but recommended) type-safety-check support (added in late
       June 2011: see JSToNative_ObjectWithInternalFieldsTypeSafe) will
       treat the subclasses as instances of the base class.

    {
    };


    /**

        interface for plugging in a bound class. Clients are not required to
        specialise this, but see this class' Initialize() for what might
        happen if they don't.

    struct ClassCreator_SetupBindings

            handle refererence is const but that object itself can be modified.

            The default implementation throws an exception deriving from
            std::exception, so it must be specialized to be useful. A default
            specialization exists because there are probably a few cases
            out there which don't really need this. But most (if not all)
            need a setup function, and this is the official one for
            ClassCreator-wrapped types. Implementations may of course simply
            forward the call to another, client-provided function.

            On error the binding should throw a NATIVE exception (ideally
            deriving from std::exception because (A) it's portable practice
            and (B) parts of the cvv8 API handles those explicitly).

            similar implementations) should take some care to make sure

            typedef ClassCreator<T> CC;
            CC & cc( CC::Instance() );
            if( cc.IsSealed() ) {

            }
            
            // ... do your bindings here...

            // As the final step:            
            cc.AddClassTo( "T", dest );
            return;
            @endcode

       A basic Native-to-JS class binding mechanism. This class does
       not aim to be a monster framework, just something simple,
       mainly for purposes of showing (and testing) what the core
       cvv8 can do.

       The framework must know how to convert JS objects to T objects,
       and for this to work client code must define a JSToNative<T>
       specialization in this manner:

       @code
           template <>
           struct JSToNative<T>
           : JSToNative_ClassCreator<T>

       @endcode

       If the internal field configuration must be customized then the
       client must define the number of fields by
       specializing/customizing the ClassCreator_InternalFields<T>
       policy class. Additionally, if the client does NOT use the
       above JSToNative<T> implementation then he should create his
       implementation by subclassing
       JSToNative_ObjectWithInternalFields<T,N,M>, where (N,M) are the
       number of internals fields and the index of the field where the
       native object is to be stored. See JSToNative_ClassCreator
       for an example.
       
       TODOs:

       - Certain operations may not work properly when inheriting
       bound classes from JS space, and possibly not even when
       inheriting bound natives from one another. That depends on
       several factors too complex to summarize here.
       
       - See how much of the v8::juice::cw::ClassWrap

           A utility function primarily intended to support various
           ClassCreator policy implementations.

           This function tries to extract a native handle from jo by
           looking in the internal field defined by
           ClassCreator_InternalFields<T>::NativeIndex.  If a native is
           found in that field and it is the same as nh, then jo is
           returned. If none is found, jo's prototype object is searched,
           recursively, until either nh is found in the prototype chain or
           the end of the chain is reached. If a match is found, the JS
           object in which the native was found is returned. This does no
           casting - it only compares by address.

           If nh is not found anywhere in the chain, an empty handle is
           returned.

           Note that T must be non-cv qualified, so it is generally
           undesirable to allow the compiler to deduce its type from the
           parameter. Thus the T template parameter should not be omitted
           from calls to this function.

        Can be used as a concrete ClassCreator_Factor<T> 
        specialization to forward JS ctor calls directly to native 
        ctors.
    
        T must be the ClassCreator'd type to construct. CtorProxy must
        be a type having this interface:
        
        @code
        TypeInfo<T>::NativeHandle Call( v8::Arguments const & );
        @endcode

        Normally CtorProxy would be CtorForwarder or CtorArityDispatcher,
        but any interface-compatible type will do.

        It must return a new object instance on success. On error it
        may return NULL and "should" throw a native exception explaining
        the problem. The exception will be caught by ClassCreator and
        transformed into a JS-side exception.

        If CtorProxy::Call() succeeds (returns non-NULL and does not throw)
        then NativeToJSMap<T> is used to create a native-to-JS mapping.

        // in the cvv8 namespace:
        template <>
            struct NativeToJS<T> : NativeToJSMap<T>::NativeToJSImpl {};
        @endcode
        
        After that, CastToJS<T>( theNativeObject ) can work.
        
        The mapping is cleaned up when (if!) the object is sent through
        the JS garbage collector or the client somehow triggers its
        JS-aware destruction (e.g. via ClassCreator::DestroyObject(),
        assuming the type was wrapped using ClassCreator).
