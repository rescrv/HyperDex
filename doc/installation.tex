\chapter{Installing HyperDex}
\label{chap:installation}

HyperDex provides multiple installation methods that provide easy access to
HyperDex in a variety of environments.  For Linux users, the easiest and most
convenient way to install HyperDex is to use pre-compiled binary packages.
Users of OS X have the option to install using Homebrew packages.  Finally,
HyperDex is also distributed as a set of tarballs so that power users may
install HyperDex in a custom manner on their platform of choice.

\section{Installing on CentOS/RedHat Using Binary Packages}

The following code snippet will install HyperDex on any 64-bit CentOS 6 or 7
system.  The script configures the HyperDex repository, imports the HyperDex
signing key, and installs the \code{hyperdex} package.  This script is available
in the HyperDex tarball or repository at \code{doc/install/centos-packages.sh}.

\inputminted[frame=lines,framesep=2mm,firstline=5]{bash}{\topdir/install/centos-packages.sh}

\noindent\textbf{Note:}  Users installing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux may have
to follow the instructions to install Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux
\footnote{\url{https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL}} prior to running the above
code.

\section{Installing on Debian Using Binary Packages}

\section{Installing From Source}
\label{sec:installation:source}


An alternative to installing a prepackaged binary is to install from source
tarballs.  This is a straightforward process that should work on most any recent
Linux distribution for which there isn't a prepackaged binary.  We'll first list
the prerequisites to installing HyperDex from a source tarball.  Then, we'll
describe how to configure HyperDex.  Finally, we'll describe the installation
step.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\label{sec:installation:source:deps}

HyperDex has a minimal number of prerequisites for installation from source.
Although we list all prerequisites in this section for completeness, the
HyperDex configuration step will automatically warn about any missing
dependencies.

Required Dependencies:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://code.google.com/p/cityhash/}{Google CityHash}:  Used for
    hashing strings.  Requires version 1.0.x

\end{itemize}

Dependencies for Python Bindings:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://python.org/}{Python}: Version 2.6 or 2.7 with the
    development headers installed.
\end{itemize}

Dependencies for Java Bindings:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://openjdk.java.net/}{Java}: We test against OpenJDK 7.  Your
    system must include \texttt{javac}, \texttt{jar}, and the JNI development
    headers.
\end{itemize}

Dependencies for Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB):

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki}{YCSB} The YCSB
    distribution is a moving target.  We generally build against the latest Git
    release.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuring}
\label{sec:installation:source:configure}

HyperDex uses the Autotools to make configuration and installation as
straightforward as possible.  After extracting the HyperDex tarball, you'll need
to configure HyperDex.  The simplest configuration installs HyperDex in its
default location (\texttt{/usr/local}) using the C++ compiler found on the
system.  The configuration is performed in the directory extracted from the
tarball and looks like:

\begin{consolecode}
./configure
\end{consolecode}

This basic configuration will configure the HyperDex daemon and native client
library components to be built; however it omits several useful options for
configuring HyperDex.  The rest of this section will highlight common ways to
configure HyperDex.  Unless otherwise noted, all options should work well
together.

\subsubsection{Java Bindings}
\label{sec:installation:source:java}

HyperDex does not build Java bindings by default.  To enable the Java bindings,
you must pass \texttt{--enable-java-bindings} to \texttt{./configure} like so:

\begin{consolecode}
./configure --enable-java-bindings
\end{consolecode}

If any of the prerequisites are missing \texttt{./configure} should fail.

\begin{quote}
Java bindings are currently unavailable in \HyperDexVersion.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Python Bindings}
\label{sec:installation:source:python}

HyperDex does not build Python bindings by default.  To enable the Python
bindings, you must pass \texttt{--enable-python-bindings} to
\texttt{./configure} like so:

\begin{consolecode}
./configure --enable-python-bindings
\end{consolecode}

If Python or its headers cannot be found, \texttt{./configure} will fail.

\subsubsection{Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark}
\label{sec:installation:source:ycsb}

HyperDex provides all the source code necessary to build a HyperDex driver
for the YCSB benchmark.  If Java bindings are enabled, then YCSB can be built
with \texttt{--enable-ycsb}.

\begin{consolecode}
./configure --enable-ycsb
\end{consolecode}

Note that YCSB must be in your Java \texttt{CLASSPATH}.  Configure cannot detect
YCSB by itself.

\subsubsection{Changing the Installation Directory}
\label{sec:installation:source:prefix}

By default HyperDex installs files in \texttt{/usr/local}.  If you'd like to
install HyperDex elsewhere, you can specify the installation prefix at configure
time.  For example, to install HyperDex in \texttt{/opt/hyperdex}:

\begin{consolecode}
./configure --prefix=/opt/hyperdex
\end{consolecode}

Check the \texttt{--help} option to configure for more ways to tune where
HyperDex places files.

\subsection{Installing}
\label{sec:installation:source:make}

Once configured, HyperDex is simple to build and install.  Keep in mind that the
following commands may fail if the installation directory is not writable by the
current user.

\begin{consolecode}
make
make install
ldconfig
\end{consolecode}

\section{Installing from Git}
\label{sec:installation:git}

Developers wishing to contribute to the development of HyperDex may build
HyperDex directly from Git.  Building from Git is as straightforward as building
from source tarballs, but requires a few extra dependencies and some setup
before the \texttt{./configure} step.

In order to build the HyperDex repository, you'll need to have the following
utilities installed.  Most of these utilities are prepacked for Linux
distributions.  Note that since these dependencies are only required for
building from Git, they will not be detected at \texttt{./configure} time and
instead \texttt{make} will fail with an error message.

Required Dependencies:

As noted in the section above on installing from tarballs, you must have the
following dependencies installed either from source or, as shown for
Debian/Ubuntu below, by package manager:

\begin{consolecode}
sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev libgoogle-glog-dev libjson-c-dev libjson0-dev
\end{consolecode}

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}{Autoconf} Used as part of
    the build system.  Required for all builds.
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/}{Automake} Used as part of
    the build system.  Required for all builds.
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/}{Libtool} Used as part of the
    build system.  Required for all builds.
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/}{Autoconf Archive}
    Used as part of the build system.  Required for all builds.
\item \href{http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/}{pkg-config}
    Used as part of the build system.  Required for all builds.
\item \href{http://flex.sourceforge.net/}{Flex} Used for building internal
    parsers.  Required for all builds.
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/}{Bison} Used for building
    internal parsers.  Required for all builds.
\item \href{http://cython.org/}{Cython} Used for building Python bindings.
    Required for \texttt{--enable-python-bindings}.
    Recommmended version: $\ge$ 0.15.
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/}{Gperf}  Generate perfect
    hashes.  Used in the client library.
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/}{help2man}  Generate manual
    pages with options.  Used for man-pages.
\item \href{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/}{pandoc}  Convert manual pages
    from markdown to man page format.
\end{itemize}

You'll need to build po6, e, BusyBee, HyperLevelDB, Replicant, and HyperDex from
Git, as the development version often introduces incompatible changes across
repositories.

Build and install the repos in the order listed above.

For each of these repositories, you may build and install the code with:

\begin{consolecode}
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
ldconfig
\end{consolecode}

\subsection{Troubleshooting}
\label{sec:installation:troubleshooting}

\subsubsection{Missing \texttt{libtool}}
\label{sec:installation:troubleshooting:libtool}

If your system is missing \texttt{libtool}, you'll see an error message like the
following:

\begin{consolecode}
configure.ac:6: installing `./install-sh'
configure.ac:6: installing `./missing'
Makefile.am:48: Libtool library used but `LIBTOOL' is undefined
Makefile.am:48:   The usual way to define `LIBTOOL' is to add `LT_INIT'
Makefile.am:48:   to `configure.ac' and run `aclocal' and `autoconf' again.
Makefile.am:48:   If `LT_INIT' is in `configure.ac', make sure
Makefile.am:48:   its definition is in aclocal's search path.
Makefile.am: installing `./depcomp'
autoreconf: automake failed with exit status: 1
\end{consolecode}

\subsubsection{Missing \texttt{pkgconfig}}
\label{sec:installation:troubleshooting:pkgconfig}

If your system is missing \texttt{pkgconfig}, you'll see an error message like
the following:

\begin{consolecode}
./configure: line 18348: syntax error near unexpected token `PO6,'
./configure: line 18348: `PKG_CHECK_MODULES(PO6, libpo6 >= 0.3.1)'
\end{consolecode}

\section{Verifying Installation}
\label{sec:installation:verify}

Once you have HyperDex installed, you should be able to view the built-in help.
If the following commands provide meaningful output, then it is very likely that
HyperDex is installed correctly and ready for use.

\begin{consolecode}
hyperdex help
hyperdex daemon --help
\end{consolecode}

\section{Upgrading to 1.4}
\label{sec:installation:upgrade1.4}

Upgrading to 1.4 is a two step process.  First, take a full backup of your
cluster using the provided backup tools.  Start the 1.4 cluster from the
backup.  This will upgrade the coordinator to 1.4, and the daemons will work
with the old data directory.

Alternatively, take a backup, and restart the coordinator from the backed-up
coordinator state on the same address.  Then do a rolling restart of the
daemons.

The 1.4 release's on-disk format is backwards incompatible with the 1.3 and
prior releases.  HyperDex daemons will automatically upgrade to the 1.4 format
when first launched.

\section{Upgrading to 1.3}
\label{sec:installation:upgrade1.3}

Upgrading to 1.3 is a two step process.  First, take a full backup of your
cluster using the provided backup tools.  Start the 1.3 cluster from the
backup.  This will upgrade the coordinator to 1.3, and the daemons will work
with the old data directory.

Alternatively, take a backup, and restart the coordinator from the backed-up
coordinator state on the same address.  Then do a rolling restart of the
daemons.

\section{Upgrading to 1.2}
\label{sec:installation:upgrade1.2}

The 1.2 release introduces new features that are backwards incompatible with
previous releases.  Before upgrading to 1.2, backup your data.  Once 1.2 is
installed, copy your data into a newly-deployed 1.2 cluster.
