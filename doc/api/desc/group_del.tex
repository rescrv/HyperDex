Asynchronously delete all objects that match the specified \code{checks}.

\paragraph{Behavior:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item This operation is roughly equivalent to a client manually deleting every
    object returned from a search, but saves HyperDex from sending to the client
    objects that are soon to be deleted.
\end{itemize}
