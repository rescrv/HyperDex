Count the number of objects that match the specified \code{checks}.

\paragraph{Behavior:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item This will return the number of objects counted by the search.  If an error
    occurs during the count, the count will reflect a partial count.  The real
    count will be higher than the returned value.  Some languages will throw an
    exception rather than return the partial count.
\end{itemize}
