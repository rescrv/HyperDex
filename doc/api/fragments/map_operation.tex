\item This operation mutates the value of a key-value pair in a map.  This call
    is similar to the equivalent call without the \code{map\_} prefix, but
    operates on the value of a pair in a map, instead of on an attribute's
    value.  If there is no pair with the specified map key, a new pair will be
    created and initialized to its default value.  If this is undesirable, it
    may be avoided by using a conditional operation that requires that the map
    contain the key in question.
