\item This operation will succeed if and only if the predicates specified by
    \code{checks} hold on the pre-existing object.  If any of the predicates are
    not true for the existing object, then the operation will have no effect and
    fail with \code{CMPFAIL}.

    All checks are atomic with the write.  HyperDex guarantees that no other
    operation will come between validating the checks, and writing the new
    version of the object..
